        Breaking down the factors of success for those in their golden years. <br> <br>
        As a 74-year-old woman in good health but with some spare tires accumulated over the last ten years, I embarked on a fitness regimen with my husband and the help of some of my weightlifting children in December of 2022.
        <br> <br>
        <strong> 1. The first key: Consistency </strong> <br>
        The most important ingredient to maintaining a fitness regimen at my age was consistency. My children introduced me to a Florida gym during vacation and put me on a rather hard-core regimen of six days a week of exercise, about 40 minutes a session. They created the classic three-day rotation of back, chest, and legs with a rest day once a week. Once the children left and I was faced with maintaining this regimen, I decided to do what I knew I could consistently commit to each week. This ended up being three days a week for the first two months in our smaller home gym which had a great weight bench and dumbbells thanks to one of my sons. Our daughter, a doctoral student in Physical Therapy, helped modify some of the exercises for home workouts.
        <br> <br>
        <strong>2. The second key: Motivation to Improve </strong>
        The second key to success was motivation to improve. After two months of three times a week exercise, my husband and I advanced to four days a week and systematically increased some of the weights during exercise while working to maintain good form. We encouraged each other to improve and stay consistent. It is important for anyone to find that motivation and there is ample medical evidence to show that consistent weight training for people over 70 not only increases strength and gains muscle mass, but also helps with balance, stress, and general mental acuity.
        <br> <br>
        <strong>3. The third key: Accountability </strong>
        
        The third key to success is accountability. This key is related to motivation, but it involves a third party. It could be a personal trainer, a friend, or in my case, our children. In June and July, we spent the summer at our vacation home in Maine with my eldest son and his wife and my middle son. We returned to the six-day regimen of workouts at our local YMCA. After some refreshers with them on the equipment, my husband and I settled into a 30–40-minute afternoon routine.
        
        There were days this was challenging for me after working in a large cottage garden. However, we adapted to the routine well and enjoyed meeting the fellow weightlifters at the gym. What helped keep me accountable was an Apple Watch gifted to me by my middle son with daily workout goals and accomplishment rings to close, plus a subscription to the MuscleWiki App. MuscleWiki became my faithful companion at the gym, helping me build and then record workouts. It tracked my previous weight and reps as well so I could easily see my progress. I generally did a set of three on a machine with 10-12 repetitions per set, but I could tailor these as needed. I particularly appreciated that the advanced female form targeted specific muscle areas that could be clicked on to reveal a variety of exercise choices. I found this feature particularly useful when I returned to our home gym and worked to modify some of the exercises that I had done in Maine.
        
        To date, my husband and I have continued to consistently do our six-day-a-week regimen of workouts at home, and I give a brief text to my eldest son when we complete a workout. I have added on a short abdomen floor workout after weight training. I use both my Apple Watch and MuscleWiki daily and I have made gains in strength, muscle development, and overall fitness. I no longer carry a spare tire and feel great. This is what truly enjoying the ‘golden years’ is all about!
