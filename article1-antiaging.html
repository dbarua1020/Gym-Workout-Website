    <p style="font-family: Roboto"> My grandmother lived to be 95 and was still sharp as a tack. But, like a lot of older folks, she started having serious trouble walking because her muscles are weak. Science says there’s a way to prevent that issue…
    </p>  <br> <br>
    <p style="font-family: Roboto">  
    <i> <h2 style="color:blue;">
          Bodybuilding </h2> </i>  <br> </p>
    <p style="font-family: Roboto"> 
First off, bodybuilding doesn’t necessarily mean heavy steroid use and looking like the Michelin Man. <br>

Merriam-Webster defines bodybuilding as the development of the body through exercise and diet. <br>

Technically, if you go to the gym for the sake of improving your body, then you’re bodybuilding. <br>

Now that we got that out of the way, on to my favorite part, the science. <br>

Why do older people have trouble walking and, in more severe cases, begin to fall because their bodies are too weak? <br>

The older you get, the more muscle you lose. <br>

It’s called sarcopenia. According to one study, <br>

Sarcopenia, or the decline of skeletal muscle tissue with age, is one of the most important causes of functional decline and loss of independence in older adults
<br>
Sarcopenia happens to a LOT of people. 10 %–16 % of the elderly worldwide. Sarcopenia is associated with a high risk of a wide range of adverse health outcomes. Physical inactivity, malnutrition, smoking, extreme sleep duration, and diabetes are related to sarcopenia
<br>
It happened to my grandmother, who has to have help going to the bathroom at this point.
<br>
Sarcopenia even happened to my Father in his mid 60s. He retired early and wasn’t using his muscles like he used to. He couldn't walk very far because muscle fatigue hits him so quickly.
